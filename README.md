Space Invader Gameboy Clone, with a bit of a tweak with text speechs, comets, and personalyl favorite images inputed.
For a University Project, wasn't fond of the class server so i made the clone in raylib since im more familiar with it.

To be able to compile, download Raylib and press F6. Or Download the .exe file.
Space to skip 
Arrow keys to move
Can use mouse

Two stages:
1. With comets, avoid or shoot them down. Be wary youll lose health if hit by it.
2. Kill as much aliens and survive.
